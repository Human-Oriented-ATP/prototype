## To-do tomorrow
- Write low-level library implication moves: backward-reasoning, forward-reasoning
- Write existential instantiation move
- Write library-style existence move


## To-do
- Do we need different types of constants? Probably not - slightly paradoxical to have them if we don't have types. Remove soon.
- Do we need a QZone in Library Equivalences? I think probably not, unless we want to significantly revamp how we're handling Library Equivalences. Remove soon (keeping for now in case it turns out to be useful).
- Think about how the variables in the QZone should behave when it comes to existence solving.
- Improve the system of finding/using ExternalName's when peeling and printing
- Think about and implement existence solving via the library
- Parser for inputting LibraryEquivalence's
- (longer term) Think about and implement existence solving in a more thorough way as discussed in document
- (longer term) Think about how we're going to handle algebra and computation (e.g. a + a should be 2a)
- (longer term) Think about how we're going to populate the library
