## To-do tomorrow
- Write library-style existence move
- Write general existence solving
- Write interface for motivated proof finder
- Write library searching algorithm
- Think about populating library

## To-do
- Do we need a QZone in Library Equivalences? I think probably not, unless we want to significantly revamp how we're handling Library Equivalences. Remove soon (keeping for now in case it turns out to be useful).
- Think about how the variables in the QZone should behave when it comes to existence solving.
- Improve the system of finding/using ExternalName's when peeling and printing
- Think about and implement existence solving via the library
- (longer term) Think about and implement existence solving in a more thorough way as discussed in document
- (longer term) Think about how we're going to handle algebra and computation (e.g. a + a should be 2a)
- (longer term) Think about how we're going to populate the library
